A predator-prey simulation involving foxes and rabbits in
an enclosed rectangular field.

How to start:
    Create an animal factory.
    Create a simulator object that takes said factory as parameter.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.

        A star wars simulation involving the jedi, stormtroopers and civilians in
an enclosed rectangular field. This simulates the final battle between good and evil,
the jedi(good) must protect the civilians from the stormtroopers(evil) so that there
may once again be peace in the universe and the civilains may grow their civilisation
without harm from the evil forces.

How to start:
    Create a person factory.
    Create a simulator object that takes said factory as parameter.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
    For your convinance there are some test methods available to run a long sim with one
    click, it is labeled: + defaultSimulationPersons().
