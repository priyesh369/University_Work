\title{My Assessment}

\maketitle

For this assessment we were asked to find out about how
widgets are made inside a fictitious software system,
which was hard since such a thing doesn't really exist.
Anyhow, this is what I discovered:

\begin{itemize}
\item	There is no ISO standard for widget sizing,
	though various ECMA standards dictate the
	{\em flavours} of widgets that should be
	provided in hardware\footnote{Orange and peach
	have reportedly been popular.}.
\item	Raptor is a CS unix host.  Raptors were also
	flying {\bf dinosaurs} that probably lived on
	cave-men around at that time.
\end{itemize}
