\section{Introduction}
For this assessment we were asked to find out about how
widgets are made inside a fictitious software system,
which was hard since such a thing doesn't really exist.
Section~\ref{sec:results} describes what I found.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
There is no ISO standard for widget sizing,
though various ECMA standards dictate the
{\em flavours} of widgets that should be
provided in hardware\footnote{Orange and peach
have reportedly been popular.}.

\subsection{Observations}
Raptor is a CS unix host.  Raptors were also
flying {\bf dinosaurs} that probably lived on
cave-men around at that time.
